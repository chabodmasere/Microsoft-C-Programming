# Microsoft C++ Course Notes

This repository contains my notes and exercises from the Microsoft C++ course, with a focus on modern C++, core language mechanics, and practical usage in real systems.

The notes emphasise:

Language fundamentals and memory model

Object-oriented and generic programming in C++

Standard Library usage and idiomatic patterns

Performance considerations and common pitfalls

Where appropriate, examples are implemented and tested to reinforce understanding rather than serve as reference-only snippets.

This repository is maintained as a working technical record of progress through the course and will evolve as more advanced topics are covered.
